s End User which shall include the relevant terms of this Agreement and release Pagoda Box from any and all liability for damages or losses Customer\rquote 
s End Users may incur as a result of using the Customer Offering. Customer may not use the Services in any situation where failu
re or fault of the Services could lead to death or serious bodily injury of any person, or to physical or environmental damage. For example, Customer may not use, or permit any other person to use, the Services in connection with aircraft or other modes o
f
 human mass transportation, nuclear or chemical facilities, or Class III medical devices under the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act. Customer may not resell any of the Services alone to any Third Party without first entering into a reseller agreement w

\par 
\par 4.4 Special Terms for Third Party Services. To the extent Customer orders Third Party Services under TPS Agreements, Pagoda Box is not responsible for such Third Party Services and the provider of the Third Party Service is solely respons
ible for providing such Third Party Services. However, the Customer also agrees that the following terms of the TOS apply to such Third Party Services: Sections 8, 9, 10, 11, 15 and 16.
\par 
\par 5. PAYMENT.
\par 5.1 Fees: Payment for all fees for the provision of Se
rvices such as servers, virtual servers, shared storage and backups shall be due on the next Anniversary Billing Date. One time fees, such as setup fees, bandwidth, storage, administrative fees and late fees, are due and payable when invoiced, and/or as a
greed by Pagoda Box through the Customer Dashboard.
\par 
\par 5.2 Payment Methods: The payment shall be made by the credit card (or other acceptable method of payment, in Pagoda Box\rquote s sole discretion) (the \'93MOP\'94) maintained on file with Pagoda Box.  Customer is re
sponsible to update the MOP periodically and failure to do so may result in the termination of this Agreement and the termination of any Applications owned by Customer in Pagoda Box\rquote 
s sole discretion. Pagoda Box is authorized to charge the MOP on file auto
matically each month on the Anniversary Billing Date for all fees incurred by Customer since the prior Anniversary Billing Date and such authorization may be revoked only prospectively as to fees not yet incurred by Customer.
\par 
\par 5.3 Taxes: All prices and f
ees specified in or referred to in this MSA are stated exclusive of any tax, including withholding tax, sales, use, value added, levies, import and custom duties, excise or other similar or equivalent taxes imposed on the supply of Services. Any sales, us
e, levies, excise, withholding taxes or similar charges, direct or indirect, applicable or to become applicable, which are levied as a result of the supply of the Services shall be paid by the Customer. Neither party shall be liable for the other party
\rquote s ta
xes based on income. If withholding tax applies to any payments for Services made under this MSA, the Customer may deduct such taxes and shall pay such taxes to the appropriate tax authority; provided that Customer shall provide Pagoda Box with an officia
l
 receipt for any such taxes withheld and must notify Pagoda Box prior to payment that withholding tax is required to be paid and Customer shall pay to Pagoda Box any additional amount to ensure that Pagoda Box receives the full amount of the invoice. If P
a
goda Box has the legal obligation to pay or collect taxes for which Customer is responsible under this paragraph, the appropriate amount shall be charged to and paid by Customer in addition to the amount of the invoice, unless Customer provides Pagoda Box
 
with a valid tax exemption certificate authorized by the appropriate taxing authority. The parties undertake to cooperate, where possible, to minimize the amount of withholding tax due by making advance clearance applications under the relevant double tax
a
tion treaties (where applicable) to the relevant tax authority to reduce the rate of withholding tax or exempt entirely this amount if applicable. In any event, the Customer undertakes to account for any tax withheld to the tax authorities on a timely bas
is.
\par 
\par 5.4 SLA Credits: SLA Credits, if issued to Customer\rquote 
s account, shall be used only to offset future charges for certain Services as provided in the Service Level Agreement. SLA Credits may not be sold, converted to cash or transferred to Third Parties
 or Affiliates. SLA Credits shall expire on the termination or expiration of the MSA.
\par 
\par 5.5 Additional Fees. The Customer\rquote s failure to pay any fees on the due date shall result in incurring a late fee of $5 per Application. If Pagoda Box has suspended the Customer\rquote 
s access to the Services over the Public Network as provided in Section 15, the Customer shall incur a $5 per Application reconnection fee. Such fees shall be due upon receipt, and Pagoda Box will not reconnect any Services to the Customer until 
full payment of such fees plus any and all amounts then due for the Services.
\par 
\par 5.6 Refunds & Disputes: All fees paid for Services to Pagoda Box are non-refundable. If the Customer believes that the bills are in error, the Customer\rquote s sole and exclusive re
medy is to seek SLA credits by sending an email to billing@nanobox.com within 30 days of the receipt of the disputed bill, which will open a billing ticket to give notice to Pagoda Box. Any invoice not disputed by Customer in accordance with this section 
w
ithin 30 days of receipt of the invoice shall be deemed conclusively accepted by Customer as correct. Customer shall not chargeback any credit card payments to Pagoda Box and any such chargeback will result in an additional payment to Pagoda Box of up to 
$500 which is a reasonable estimate of Pagoda Box\rquote s additional administrative costs to contest any such chargeback. Customer is responsible for any fees and costs (including, but not limited to, reasonable attorneys\rquote 
 fees, court costs and collection agency fees) incurred by Pagoda Box in enforcing collection of fees.
\par 
\par 6. OWNERSHIP OF SITE: Customer hereby acknowledges and agrees that Pagoda Box (or its licensors) own all legal right, title and interest in and to the Site and the Services provided by Pagoda

\par 
\par 7. SECURITY: Pagoda B
ox agrees to maintain reasonable and appropriate measures related to physical security to protect Customer Content. Other than responsibility for physical security, Customer shall be solely responsible for data maintenance, integrity, retention, security,
 
and backup of the Customer Content. Pagoda Box will take commercially reasonable steps to maintain the confidentiality of the Customer Content in performing data backup services, which backup services are not redundant, and not geographically distributed.
 
If Customer transfers or is otherwise involved in the transfer of any Customer Content (whether in connection with its business or otherwise) over the Public Network or Private Networks, then Customer is solely responsible for compliance with any applicab
le laws, rules and regulations in any and all applicable regions or countries regarding the security, privacy, legality and/or safe handling of such Customer Content.
\par 
\par 8. INDEMNIFICATION BY CUSTOMER: Customer hereby agrees to indemnify, defend and hold ha
rmless Pagoda Box and its parents, Affiliates, licensors and providers of Third Party Services, and their respective directors, officers, employees, contractors, agents, successors, and assigns, (collectively, the \'93Pagoda Box Parties\'94

ave been caused by Customer or Customer End Users to the Site or Services; or (e) any actual or alleged violation or non-compliance by Customer or Customer End Users with any applicable law, court order, rule or regulation in any jurisdiction. The counsel
 
which Customer selects for the defense or settlement of a Claim must be approved in writing in advance by Pagoda Box prior to such counsel being engaged to represent the Indemnified Parties. Customer shall not in any event consent to any judgment, settlem
ent, attachment, or lien, or any other act adverse to the interests of Pagoda Box or any Pagoda Box Party without the prior written consent of Pagoda Box and/or the applicable Pagoda Box Party(s). Customer and Customer\rquote 
s counsel will cooperate as fully as reasonably required, and provide such information as reasonably requested, by the Pagoda Box or the Pagoda Box Parties in the defense or settlement of any such matter.

\par 
\par 13. TRADEMARKS. Customer hereby grants to Pagoda Box a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free, fully paid-up license during the Term to use Customer\rquote s trademarks, marks, logos or trade names in connection with Pagoda Box\rquote

\par 
\par Normal Methods of Resolution for Violations of Nanobox\rquote s Acceptable Use Policy
\par The goal of our Normal Methods of Resolution is to mitigate service interruptions while resolving potential violations under this AUP.  Our sales, support and abu
se staffs are dedicated to working with the Customer in resolving potential violations, and are available via support ticket / email. The Normal Methods of Resolution below is provided for informational purposes only and forms the framework and guidance w
i
th respect to resolving potential violations.  However, Pagoda Box reserves the right to take immediate action to address any violation of its Acceptable Use Policy at any time in its sole discretion, and you should not assume that any particular violatio
n
 of the AUP will be handled as set forth below.  Even for violations that are handled in accordance with these procedures, timing, order, and speed of these procedures for resolution may differ according to the degree of the violation, the nature of the v
iolation, involvement of law enforcement, involvement of third party litigation, or other related factors.
\par 
\par Step 1: First alleged violation of AUP: a ticket will be generated under Pagoda Box to provide the Customer\rquote s master user with information regardin
g the potential violation of the Nanobox AUP. This is often a fact-finding email requiring further information or notifying Customer of the potential violation and the required actions to resolve the issue.
\par 
\par Step 2: Acknowledgment of violation of AUP: a ticket is generated under the Customer\rquote 
s user account with information specific to the violation. This ticket will also include any additional facts about the situation and will notify Customer of the action required to resolve the violation.
\par 
\par Step 3: Vi
olation of AUP disregarded, not properly addressed, or continuing violation if a ticket has been disregarded, not properly addressed, or resolved by the Customer for a specified period of time: Pagoda Box engineers will turn the public network port to the
 
specified dedicated services off. Access to the dedicated services may then be achieved through the secure private service network for Customer resolution. As soon as the violation is addressed, the public access shall be restored and service will continu
e as normal.
\par 
\par Step 4: Failure to address violation and resolve violation: if Customer fails to address the violation AND fails to resolve the violation, a suspension of services shall occur. This is a last resort for Pagoda Box and only results when the C
ustomer completely fails to participate in Pagoda Box\rquote s resolution process. A permanent suspension of services includes reclamation of all dedicated services and the destruction of Customer\rquote s data.
\par 
\par Disclaimer: Pagoda Box retains the right, at its sole discretion, to refuse new service to any individual, group, or business. Pagoda Box also retains the right to discontinue service to Customers with excessive and/or multiple repeated violations.

other similarly situated Agents, who may require the information in order to complete the transaction (as used here, \'93Agents\'94 are persons or companies who act on behalf of or under the direction of Pagoda Box).

\par \bullet  To our contractors who provide services or perform functions on our behalf.
\par 
\par \bullet  If we are acquired by or merged with another company, if substantially all of our assets are transferred to another company, or as part of a bankruptcy proceeding, we may transfer the information we have collected from you to another
 entity if applicable.
\par 
\par \bullet  To better tailor marketing to User needs. We may use information from User purchases and User-specified requirements to provide you with timely and pertinent notices of Pagoda Box product releases and service developments that a
ddress your needs and specified requirements and/or which are similar to products and services previously purchased by the User from Pagoda Box.
\par 
\par \bullet  To better respond to requests for service or quotes for product and equipment purchase. Pagoda Box will pass contact information to the appropriate Pagoda Box sales person, or reseller for follow-up related to Pagoda Box products or services.

\par 
\par \bullet  From referral \'93tell a friend\'94 function. If a User elects to use our referral service for informing a friend about our Site, we ask them for the friend\rquote 
s name and email address. Pagoda Box will automatically send the friend a one-time email inviting them to visit the Site and send a copy of said e-mail to the User. The e-mail(s) sent shall clearly identify the sender o
f such email(s). Pagoda Box uses this data for the sole purpose of sending this onetime email. Such email sent to a friend at User\rquote s request will not be stored for additional processing.
\par 
\par \bullet  As a result of your participation in interactive discussions and
 public forums. There are parts of the Site that permit you to participate in interactive discussions. Some of these are moderated; all are subject to access for technical reasons. Pagoda Box does not control the content that Users post and some may serve

\par 
\par Customer Dashboard, Customer Customization, Preferences and Opt-Out
\par 
\par New Customers are automatically registered for access at dashboard.nanobox.io/users/register. The Customer Dashboard allows Customers the ability to create accounts and opt in (or out) of Services and mailing lists. The Customer Dashboard p
rovides the Customers with control over their preferences for electronic information delivery.
\par 
\par Pagoda Box has also provided the Customer\rquote s master user the ability to manage the Customer\rquote s Account Information. We maintain the data and allow the Customer\rquote 
s master user to update it at any time. To change this information, you must be a current Customer and login with a user ID and password and follow the prompts to \'93update my profile\'94
 on the Customer Dashboard. We continue to expand the profile of Services and information that you may access and update.
\par 
\par Please note that some email communications are not subject to general opt-out. These include communications related to downloads; communications about sales transactions; information about software updates
, patches and fixes; disclosures to comply with legal requirements; and network upgrades or other related maintenance for Service.
\par 
\par If an individual\rquote s PII is to be (a) disclosed by Pagoda Box (other than as the result of an Application or Customer Conten
t utilizing the Services) to a Third Party who is not an Agent; or (b) used by Pagoda Box (other than as a result of an Application or Customer Content utilizing the Services)  for a purpose that is incompatible with the purpose(s) for which it was origin
a
lly collected or subsequently authorized by the individual, then the individual will be notified prior to such disclosure and may opt-out of the disclosure by responding to the email and/or author of the notification, using any response method designated 
by Pagoda Box in the notification..
\par 
\par Security
\par Pagoda Box is concerned with the security of the data we have collected and utilizes commercially reasonable measures to prevent unauthorized access to that information. These measures include policies, proce
dures, employee training, physical access and technical elements relating to data access controls. In addition, Pagoda Box uses standard security protocols and mechanisms to facilitate the exchange and the transmission of sensitive data, such as credit ca
rd details. Pagoda Box does not process PII in a way that is incompatible with the purposes for which it has been collected or subsequently authorized by the individual.
\par 
\par In the event that PII is acquired, or is reasonably believed to have been acquired, 
by an unauthorized person and applicable law requires notification, Pagoda Box will notify the affected individual of the breach by email or ticket on the Customer Dashboard or, if Pagoda Box is unable to contact the individual by email or ticket on the C
u
stomer Dashboard, then by regular mail. Notice will be given promptly, consistent with the legitimate needs of law enforcement and any measures necessary for Pagoda Box or law enforcement to determine the scope of the breach and to ensure or restore the i
n
tegrity of the data system. Pagoda Box may delay notification if Pagoda Box or a law enforcement agency determines that the notification will impede a criminal investigation, and in such case, notification will not be provided unless and until Pagoda Box 
or the agency determines that notification will not compromise the investigation.
\par 
\par Enforcement
\par Pagoda Box has established internal mechanisms to verify its ongoing adherence to its privacy policy. Pagoda Box also encourages individuals covered by this pr
ivacy policy to raise any concerns about our processing of personal information by contacting Pagoda Box at the address below. Pagoda Box will seek to resolve any concerns. 
\par 
\par Policy Updates
\par If we are going to use your PII in a manner different from that
 stated at the time of collection, we will notify you via email. In addition, if we make any material changes in our privacy practices that do not affect the PII already stored in our database, we will notify you by email or post a prominent notice on the
 
Customer Dashboard notifying users of the change. In some cases, when we post the notice, we will also email users who have opted to receive communications from us, notifying them of the changes in our privacy practices. We may update this policy from tim
e to time to describe how new site features affect our use of your PII and to let you know of new control and preference features that we provide.
